# Welcome to the community!

![EasternTownhallMainPage](https://github.com/C3ETH/.github/blob/main/assets/EasternTownhallMainPage.JPG)

We are a group of people with varying backgrounds who share a unified interest in Cardano and set out to:
- introduce, 
- educate, 
- discuss and,
- do projects in Cardano, specifically for people and friends in the Eastern Hemisphere countries.

## What is Cardano?

Cardano is a global decentralised open-source project Proof-of-Stake blockchain network, allowing people all over the world to cooperate, collaborate, propose, fund, and deploy markets for financial solutions and applications to build economic wellbeing for millions.

## What do the Catalyst Community do?

We are helping community members from a wide variety of countries and languages to onboard and enable the widest participation possible. Moreover, we are also dedicating ourselves to localizing every piece of Cardano Catalyst content and making it accessible across the globe.

## Which countries are involved in the Eastern Hemisphere?

As of now, we have members from Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Phillipines, and South Korea. Hence, we are called the Eastern Townhall team.

## C3ETH Stake Pool

As a community that puts forward the concept of decentralization, Eastern Townhall also operates a stake pool or validator node called C3ETH, which stands for Cardano Catalyst Community Eastern Townhall. The mission is to become one of the stakeholders in the Cardano network, dedicated to maintaining and securing the blockchain by staking some ADA assets and involving itself in the block mining process. Rewards from this activity are shared between the community’s treasury and delegators (people or community members whose crypto was used in the process).

Please support us as we continue expanding our reach to friends and people in the Eastern Hemisphere, spreading the positivity and impacts that could be derived from the development of the Cardano blockchain, especially with the Catalyst Project. 

If you're interested in delegating a portion of your ADA to our stake pool, C3ETH, please see the information below.

## Has the Eastern Townhall team submitted any proposals to Project Catalyst? 

Yes, we have. We started submitting proposals to Project Catalyst in Fund 6, and since then we have made a lot of engagements with the community. Not only within the Eastern Hemisphere countries, but our efforts also reached out to other Cardano communities and some projects that built on Cardano.

These are our funded proposals to this day:
