We are a group of people with varying backgrounds who share a unified interest in Cardano and set out to:
- introduce, 
- educate, 
- discuss and,
- do projects in Cardano, specifically for people and friends in the Eastern Hemisphere countries.

## What is Cardano?

Cardano is a global decentralised open-source project Proof-of-Stake blockchain network, allowing people all over the world to cooperate, collaborate, propose, fund, and deploy markets for financial solutions and applications to build economic wellbeing for millions.

## What do the Catalyst Community do?

We are helping community members from a wide variety of countries and languages to onboard and enable the widest participation possible. Moreover, we are also dedicating ourselves to localizing every piece of Cardano Catalyst content and making it accessible across the globe.

## Which countries are in the Eastern Hemisphere community?

As of now, we have members from Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Phillipines, and South Korea.
